## Place Eyeball \[55 points\]
You can create eyeball "cameras" by plucking out your own eye and placing or throwing it in the world. It takes a Ready action to pluck out an eye, after which it can be placed or thrown and it sticks to the first object it touches. After an eye is placed in the world, you can see out of it by taking a minute to concentrate, it takes another second of concentration to stop looking out of it. You can only have a number of eyes out in the world equal to your half your HT level (round down). After you've reached your limit, creating a new eyeball causes the oldest eyeball to vanish. You can also manually dispel an eyeball which is within your range as a free action.

You are only able to access eyes that are within your range. The base range for this ability is 10 yards.

This power also has additional options to enhance it:

### Increased Range \[+5 points per level\]
Each level of this increases the range:
|Level|Range Multiplier|Total Points|
|-----|----------------|------------|
|1|2x|5|
|2|5x|10|
|3|10x|15
|4|20x|20
|5|50x|25
|6|100x|0
Further levels follow the same "2-5-10" progression.

### Aware \[+25 points\]
You no longer lose the ability to sense around yourself while looking through your eyes. You can still only proritize either the eye you are looking through or your body, so whichever when doing things on the unprioritized side you are at -4 to any rolls that rely on your sense of sight.
